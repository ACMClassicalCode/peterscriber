A basic transcriber that can take a directory of audio files and output a transcription in a txt file.

Currently only supports mp3 files!

Put files you want to transcribe within a directory called assets at the root of the repo

To use:

1. Install python packages (within a venv if you want decent organization):

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Put files you want to transcribe within a directory called assets at the root of the repo

3. Run src/main.py
